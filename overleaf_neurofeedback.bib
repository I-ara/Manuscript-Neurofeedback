  abstract = {Two hundred and twenty-six females and 104 young adult males indicated the extent to which 80 comments concerning chocolate applied to them. Factor analysis indicated that three factors accounted for these data. The first factor was weighted on questions that indicated a craving for chocolate and the tendency to seek comfort from chocolate under emotionally stressful conditions: it was labelled craving. The second factor was weighted with comments that reported that negative feelings were associated with eating chocolate and dissatisfaction with weight and body image: it was labelled guilt. A third factor reflected a functional approach, for example chocolate was used to give energy when taking exercise or if a meal was missed. Craving but not guilt was associated with the eating of chocolate bars. A high guilt score was associated with a tendency to report symptoms such as bingeing and vomiting.},

  abstract = {Cue reactivity and craving can be influenced by cue exposure with response prevention (CERP). This study investigated the neural correlates of CERP using functional magnetic resonance imaging, while participants smelled chocolate (17 participants) or a control object (17 participants). CERP was interrupted by 7 scanning sequences measuring the brain response to neutral and chocolate pictures. Chocolate craving was hypothesized to be mirrored by activation in brain reward regions. As expected, control group craving remained similar throughout the session. A short exposure (30 min) increased chocolate craving in the experimental group, which was mirrored by significant group differences in activation in brain reward regions. Unexpectedly, a long exposure (60 min) did not lead to craving extinction in the experimental group, although craving started to decrease at this point. On a neural level, however, activation in regions of interest in the experimental group seemed to have extinguished after the long exposure, as activation levels returned to or fell below control group levels. These results indicate that brain reward activation during CERP is linked to craving, at least for a short exposure. Regarding a longer exposure, the decline in brain reward activation in the experimental group may be a precursor of a decrease in craving.},

  abstract = {A person can alternate between food-related mindsets, which in turn may depend on one's emotional state or situation. Being in a certain mindset can influence food-related thoughts, but interestingly it might also affect eating-related physiological responses. The current study investigates the influence of an induced ‘loss of control’ mindset as compared to an ‘in control’ mindset on hormonal, neural and behavioural responses to chocolate stimuli. Mindsets were induced by having female chocolate lovers view a short movie during two sessions in a within-subjects design. Neural responses to visual chocolate stimuli were measured using an ultra-high field (7T) scanner. Momentary ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels were determined on five moments and were simultaneously assessed with self-reports on perceptions of chocolate craving, hunger and feelings of control. Furthermore, chocolate intake was measured using a bogus chocolate taste test. It was hypothesized that the loss of control mindset would lead to hormonal, neural and behavioural responses that prepare for ongoing food intake, even after eating, while the control mindset would lead to responses reflecting satiety. Results show that neural activity in the mesocorticolimbic system was stronger for chocolate stimuli than for neutral stimuli and that ghrelin and GLP-1 levels responded to food intake, irrespective of mindset. Self-reported craving and actual chocolate intake were affected by mindset, in that cravings and intake were higher with a loss of control mindset than with a control mindset. Interestingly, these findings suggest that physiology on the one hand (hormonal and neural responses) and behavior and subjective experience (food intake and craving) on the other hand are not in sync, are not equally affected by mindset.},

  abstract = {Research investigating neural responses to visual food stimuli has produced inconsistent results. Crucially, highcaloric palatable foods have a double-sided nature – they are often craved but are also considered unhealthy –which may have contributed to the inconsistency in the literature. Taking this double-sided nature into account in the current study, neural responses to individually tailored palatable and unpalatable high caloric food stimuli were measured, while participants’ (females with overweight: n = 23) attentional focus was manipulated to be either hedonic or neutral. Notably, results showed that the level of neural activity was not significantly different for palatable than for unpalatable food stimuli. Instead, independent of food palatability, several brain regions (including regions in the mesocorticolimbic system) responded more strongly when attentional focus was hedonic than when neutral (p {$<$} 0.05, cluster-based FWE corrected). Multivariate analyses showed that food palatability could be decoded from multi-voxel patterns of neural activity (p {$<$} 0.05, FDR corrected), mostly with a hedonic attentional focus. These findings illustrate that the level of neural activity might not be proportionate to the palatability of foods, but that food palatability can be decoded from multi-voxel patterns of neural activity. Moreover, they underline the importance of considering attentional focus when measuring foodrelated neural responses.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The current study tests the influence of two factors, the obesogenic environment and impulsivity, on food intake in primary school children. Our current food environment offers a large variety of cheap and easily available sweet and fatty foods. This obesogenic environment is believed to be a cause of the recent obesity epidemic. Impulsive people are generally less successful at inhibiting prepotent responses and they are reward sensitive. We investigate whether the interaction between an obesogenic environment and an impulsive person leads to overeating. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental 2 (reward sensitive versus not reward sensitive) by 2 (successful response inhibitors versus unsuccessful response inhibitors) by 2 (monotonous versus varied food environment) between-subjects design with caloric intake during a taste test as the main dependent variable. The link between impulsivity and overweight was also examined. SUBJECTS: 78 healthy primary school children (age: 8-10 years). MEASUREMENTS: We measured two aspects of impulsivity: reward sensitivity and deficient response inhibition. Subsequently, one aspect of the obesogenic environment was manipulated; half of the participants received monotonous food during a bogus taste test whereas the other half tasted food that was varied in colour, form, taste and texture. RESULTS: As expected, reward sensitivity interacted with variety. In the monotony group there was no difference in food intake between the less and more reward-sensitive children (183 kcal+/-23 s.d. versus 180 kcal+/-21 s.d.). However, in the variety group the more reward-sensitive children ingested significantly more calories than the less reward-sensitive children (237 kcal+/-30 s.d. versus 141 kcal+/-19 s.d.). Reward sensitivity was not linked to overweight. Deficient response inhibition did not interact with variety, but it was linked to overweight. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that reward sensitivity could be a causal mechanism for overeating in an obesogenic environment whereas prepotent response inhibition may be a maintaining factor of the problem of overeating.},

This research tests the hypothesis that exposure to food advertising during TV viewing may also contribute to obesity by triggering automatic snacking of available food. DESIGN: In Experiments 1a and 1b, elementary-school-age children watched a cartoon that contained either food advertising or advertising for other products and received a snack while watching. In Experiment 2, adults watched a TV program that included food advertising that promoted snacking and/or fun product benefits, food advertising that promoted nutrition benefits, or no food advertising. The adults then tasted and evaluated a range of healthy to unhealthy snack foods in an apparently separate experiment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Amount of snack foods consumed during and after advertising exposure. RESULTS: Children consumed 45\% more when exposed to food advertising. Adults consumed more of both healthy and unhealthy snack foods following exposure to snack food advertising compared to the other conditions. In both experiments, food advertising increased consumption of products not in the presented advertisements, and these effects were not related to reported hunger or other conscious influences. CONCLUSION: These experiments demonstrate the power of food advertising to prime automatic eating behaviors and thus influence far more than brand preference alone.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that people adjust their intake directly to that of their eating companions; they eat more when others eat more, and less when others inhibit intake. A potential explanation for this modeling effect is that both eating companions' food intake becomes synchronized through processes of behavioral mimicry. No study, however, has tested whether behavioral mimicry can partially account for this modeling effect. To capture behavioral mimicry, real-time observations of dyads of young females having an evening meal were conducted. It was assessed whether mimicry depended on the time of the interaction and on the person who took the bite. A total of 70 young female dyads took part in the study, from which the total number of bites (N = 3,888) was used as unit of analyses. For each dyad, the total number of bites and the exact time at which each person took a bite were coded. Behavioral mimicry was operationalized as a bite taken within a fixed 5-second interval after the other person had taken a bite, whereas non-mimicked bites were defined as bites taken outside the 5-second interval. It was found that both women mimicked each other's eating behavior. They were more likely to take a bite of their meal in congruence with their eating companion rather than eating at their own pace. This behavioral mimicry was found to be more prominent at the beginning than at the end of the interaction. This study suggests that behavioral mimicry may partially account for social modeling of food intake.},

This means that soon after, the cues alone can trigger food cue reactivity and food cravings. The learned cue reactivity increases the probability of (over)eating and might sabotage dieting. It is argued that for successful dieting it is necessary to extinguish learned cue reactivity. To reach that goal, the way of dieting is relevant: dieters who avoid highly palatable food cues and dieters who intermittently keep eating high-calorie high-fat palatable foods will remain cue reactive. Only dieters who expose themselves to highly palatable food cues without eating them are expected to show the desired extinction of cue reactivity. Extinction of cue reactivity can be accelerated by prolonged cue exposure with response prevention. During the exposure the overeater is exposed to the cues (e.g., smell and sight of tasty foods) that elicit appetite or craving. The exposure is long lasting and without eating. Whether cue exposure with response prevention is an effective intervention that promotes successful dieting remains to be studied.keywordsconditioned stimulusanorexia nervosaunconditioned stimulusbinge eatingbulimia nervosathese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

  abstract = {Obesity reached pandemic proportions and weight-loss treatments are mostly ineffective. The level of brain activity in the reward circuitry is proposed to be proportionate to the reward value of food stimuli, and stronger in people with obesity. However, empirical evidence is inconsistent. This may be due to the double-sided nature of high caloric palatable foods: at once highly palatable and high in calories (unhealthy). This study hypothesizes that, viewing high caloric palatable foods, a hedonic attentional focus compared to a health and a neutral attentional focus elicits more activity in reward-related brain regions, mostly in people with obesity. Moreover, caloric content and food palatability can be decoded from multivoxel patterns of activity most accurately in people with obesity and in the corresponding attentional focus. During one fMRI-session, attentional focus (hedonic, health, neutral) was manipulated using a one-back task with individually tailored food stimuli in 32 healthy-weight people and 29 people with obesity. Univariate analyses (p~{$<~$}0.05, FWE-corrected) showed that brain activity was not different for palatable vs. unpalatable foods, nor for high vs. low caloric foods. Instead, this was higher in the hedonic compared to the health and neutral attentional focus. Multivariate analyses (MVPA) (p~{$<~$}0.05, FDR-corrected) showed that palatability and caloric content could be decoded above chance level, independently of either BMI or attentional focus. Thus, brain activity to visual food stimuli is neither proportionate to the reward value (palatability and/or caloric content), nor significantly moderated by BMI. Instead, it depends on people's attentional focus, and may reflect motivational salience. Furthermore, food palatability and caloric content are represented as patterns of brain activity, independently of BMI and attentional focus. So, food reward value is reflected in patterns, not levels, of brain activity.},

The current article reviews the variety literature with a specific focus on the factors that moderate the effects of variety on food intake and that moderate the processes that may underlie the variety effect (i.e., sensory-specific satiety and monotony). The moderators have been categorized as being of either an internal nature or an external nature. The literature suggests that internal moderators, including characteristics such as gender, weight, and dietary restraint, do not act as moderators of the variety effect. One possible exception to the absence of internal moderators is old age. Alternatively, external moderators, such as particular properties of food and the eater's perception of the situation, appear to affect the strength of the variety effect on intake to some degree. An evolutionary hypothesis may account for the distinct roles that internal and external variables play in moderating the variety effect.

Methods 41 overweight adolescents (aged 12–18 years) were randomly assigned to a cue exposure intervention or a lifestyle intervention (control condition). Habituation of food cue reactivity (self-reported desire to eat and salivation) and CS-US expectancy were measured during both sessions, and EAH was measured at the end of session two. Results Compared to the control condition, the cue exposure condition showed less EAH for the exposed food item as well as for the non-exposed food items. Larger within-session (WSH) and between-session habituation (BSH) of cue reactivity were not related to less EAH, change in CS-US expectancy was unrelated to EAH. Limitations The study was underpowered, and compliance to homework instructions between sessions was poor, intervention effects might have been larger when participants adhered to daily homework exercises. Conclusions Food cue exposure was effective to reduce EAH of exposed and non-exposed food items, indicating generalisability of the exposure effect. In line with exposure effects in anxiety disorders, habituation was not found to benefit outcome, though the present data do also not provide evidence that CS-US expectancy violation predicts EAH.},
