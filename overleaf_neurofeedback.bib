A third factor reflected a functional approach, for example chocolate was used to give energy when taking exercise or if a meal was missed. Craving but not guilt was associated with the eating of chocolate bars. A high guilt score was associated with a tendency to report symptoms such as bingeing and vomiting.},

Studies of BED therapies include pharmacological interventions, psychological and behavioral interventions, or combinations of approaches. We examined whether treatment effectiveness differed in patient subgroups and described course of illness for BED and LOC eating., We searched MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, the Cochrane Library, Academic OneFile, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) through January 19, 2015. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomized trials, meta-analyses, and, for course of illness, cohort and case-control studies., Pairs of reviewers independently selected, extracted data from, and rated the risk of bias of relevant studies; they graded the strength of evidence using established criteria. We conducted meta-analysis for some treatment outcomes., Of 52 included RCTs of treatment; 48 concerned BED therapy. Course-of-illness evidence came from 15 observational studies. We examined four major outcomes: binge eating and abstinence, eating-related psychopathology, weight, and general psychological and other outcomes. Second-generation antidepressants (as a class), topiramate (an anticonvulsant), and lisdexamfetamine (a stimulant) were superior to placebo in achieving abstinence and reducing binge episodes and/or binge days and eating-related obsessions and compulsions. Second-generation antidepressants decreased depression. Topiramate and lisdexamfetamine produced weight reduction in study populations whose members were virtually all overweight or obese. A few formats of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)—therapist led, partially therapist led, and guided self-help—were superior to placebo in achieving abstinence and reducing binge frequency. CBT for BED was generally ineffective for reducing weight or depression in this population. Therapist-led CBT was not superior to either partially therapist-led CBT or structured self-help CBT for binge-eating and weight outcomes. Behavioral weight loss treatment produced greater weight loss than CBT at the end of treatment but not over the longer run. Topiramate, fluvoxamine, and lisdexamfetamine were associated with sleep disturbance, including insomnia; topiramate and lisdexamfetamine were associated with sympathetic nervous system arousal and headache. We found no evidence on bariatric surgery patients. Treatments for LOC eating in children did not achieve superior weight reduction outcomes. Evidence on the course of either illness was limited. Early adolescent BED and LOC eating predicts such behaviors in the future., BED patients may benefit from treatment with second-generation antidepressants, lisdexamfetamine, topiramate, and CBT. Additional studies should address other treatments, combinations of treatment, and comparisons between treatments; treatment for postbariatric surgery patients and children; and the course of these illnesses.},

This randomized-controlled pilot study examined the effectiveness and feasibility of two EEG neurofeedback paradigms in the reduction of binge eating, eating disorder and general psychopathology, executive functioning, and EEG activity. Adults with BED and overweight (N = 39) were randomly assigned to either a food-specific EEG neurofeedback paradigm, aiming at reducing fronto-central beta activity and enhancing theta activity after viewing highly palatable food pictures, or a general EEG neurofeedback paradigm training the regulation of slow cortical potentials. In both conditions, the study design included a waiting period of 6~weeks, followed by 6~weeks EEG neurofeedback (10 sessions à 30~min) and a 3-month follow-up period. Both EEG neurofeedback paradigms significantly reduced objective binge-eating episodes, global eating disorder psychopathology, and food craving. Approximately one third of participants achieved abstinence from objective binge-eating episodes after treatment without any differences between treatments. These results were stable at 3-month follow-up. Among six measured executive functions, only decision making improved at posttreatment in both paradigms, and cognitive flexibility was significantly improved after food-specific neurofeedback only. Both EEG neurofeedback paradigms were equally successful in reducing relative beta and enhancing relative theta power over fronto-central regions. The results highlight EEG neurofeedback as a promising treatment option for individuals with BED. Future studies in larger samples are needed to determine efficacy and treatment mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Although minimisation methods have frequently been advocated for treatment allocation in clinical trials, they are not widely used. As this may partly be due to the complexity of the methods, we devised a new and simple minimisation method to balance for prognostic factors, called sequential balancing. Each factor is dealt with sequentially and when a new subject enters the trial, he or she is allocated the treatment that leads to improved balance of the first factor over the treatments. If the balance of the first factor was already satisfactory, then the treatment is allocated that leads to improved balance of the second factor and so on. The algorithm requires no calculations. We simulated a realistic trial and compared the performance of this method to the performance of alternative allocation strategies: the variance minimisation method, simple randomisation and stratification. The sequential balancing method led to better balance than randomisation and stratification. In the case of four factors or less, the performance of the sequential balancing method and the variance minimisation method were comparable and the sequence of the factors was not very relevant. When more factors were introduced, the balance of the sequential method remained comparable with the balance achieved with the variance minimisation method for the first four factors, but it started to decrease from the fifth factor onwards. We conclude that the ease and simplicity of the new method make it an attractive option when balance is required for four factors or less. If there are more than four factors, the sequential balancing method may still be an acceptable option, but the advantage of simplicity has to be weighed against the loss of performance compared to other minimisation methods.},

Here we report an fMRI NF study of brain activity associated with kinesthetic motor imagery (kMI), analyzed using partial least squares (PLS), a multivariate analysis technique. Thirteen healthy young adult subjects performed kMI involving each hand separately, with NF training targeting regions of interest (ROIs) in the left and right primary motor cortex (M1). Throughout, subjects attempted to maximize a laterality index (LI) of brain activity—the difference in activity between the contralateral ROI (relative to the hand involved in kMI) and the ipsilateral M1 ROI—while receiving real-time updates on a visual display. Six of 13 subjects were successful in increasing the LI value, whereas the other 7 were not successful and performed similarly to 5 control subjects who received sham NF training. Ability to suppress activity in the ipsilateral M1 ROI was the primary driver of successful NF performance. Multiple PLS analyses depicted activated networks of brain regions involved with imagery, self-awareness, and feedback processing, and additionally showed that activation of the task positive network was correlated with task performance. These results indicate that fMRI NF of kMI is capable of modulating brain activity in primary motor regions in a subset of the population. In the future, such methods may be useful in the development of NF training methods for enhancing motor rehabilitation following stroke.},

This study investigated the neural correlates of CERP using functional magnetic resonance imaging, while participants smelled chocolate (17 participants) or a control object (17 participants). CERP was interrupted by 7 scanning sequences measuring the brain response to neutral and chocolate pictures. Chocolate craving was hypothesized to be mirrored by activation in brain reward regions. As expected, control group craving remained similar throughout the session. A short exposure (30 min) increased chocolate craving in the experimental group, which was mirrored by significant group differences in activation in brain reward regions. Unexpectedly, a long exposure (60 min) did not lead to craving extinction in the experimental group, although craving started to decrease at this point. On a neural level, however, activation in regions of interest in the experimental group seemed to have extinguished after the long exposure, as activation levels returned to or fell below control group levels. These results indicate that brain reward activation during CERP is linked to craving, at least for a short exposure. Regarding a longer exposure, the decline in brain reward activation in the experimental group may be a precursor of a decrease in craving.},

  abstract = {A person can alternate between food-related mindsets, which in turn may depend on one's emotional state or situation. Being in a certain mindset can influence food-related thoughts, but interestingly it might also affect eating-related physiological responses. The current study investigates the influence of an induced ‘loss of control’ mindset as compared to an ‘in control’ mindset on hormonal, neural and behavioural responses to chocolate stimuli. Mindsets were induced by having female chocolate lovers view a short movie during two sessions in a within-subjects design. Neural responses to visual chocolate stimuli were measured using an ultra-high field (7T) scanner. Momentary ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels were determined on five moments and were simultaneously assessed with self-reports on perceptions of chocolate craving, hunger and feelings of control. Furthermore, chocolate intake was measured using a bogus chocolate taste test. It was hypothesized that the loss of control mindset would lead to hormonal, neural and behavioural responses that prepare for ongoing food intake, even after eating, while the control mindset would lead to responses reflecting satiety. Results show that neural activity in the mesocorticolimbic system was stronger for chocolate stimuli than for neutral stimuli and that ghrelin and GLP-1 levels responded to food intake, irrespective of mindset. Self-reported craving and actual chocolate intake were affected by mindset, in that cravings and intake were higher with a loss of control mindset than with a control mindset. Interestingly, these findings suggest that physiology on the one hand (hormonal and neural responses) and behavior and subjective experience (food intake and craving) on the other hand are not in sync, are not equally affected by mindset.},

Crucially, highcaloric palatable foods have a double-sided nature – they are often craved but are also considered unhealthy –which may have contributed to the inconsistency in the literature. Taking this double-sided nature into account in the current study, neural responses to individually tailored palatable and unpalatable high caloric food stimuli were measured, while participants’ (females with overweight: n = 23) attentional focus was manipulated to be either hedonic or neutral. Notably, results showed that the level of neural activity was not significantly different for palatable than for unpalatable food stimuli. Instead, independent of food palatability, several brain regions (including regions in the mesocorticolimbic system) responded more strongly when attentional focus was hedonic than when neutral (p {$<$} 0.05, cluster-based FWE corrected). Multivariate analyses showed that food palatability could be decoded from multi-voxel patterns of neural activity (p {$<$} 0.05, FDR corrected), mostly with a hedonic attentional focus. These findings illustrate that the level of neural activity might not be proportionate to the palatability of foods, but that food palatability can be decoded from multi-voxel patterns of neural activity. Moreover, they underline the importance of considering attentional focus when measuring foodrelated neural responses.},

  abstract = {Emotional eating is commonly defined as the tendency to (over)eat in response to emotion. Insofar as it involves the (over)consumption of high-calorie palatable foods, emotional eating is a maladaptive behavior that can lead to eating disorders, and ultimately to metabolic disorders and obesity. Emotional eating is associated with eating disorder subtypes and with abnormalities in emotion processing at a behavioral level. However, not enough is known about the neural pathways involved in both emotion processing and food intake. In this review, we provide an overview of recent neuroimaging studies, highlighting the brain correlates between emotions and eating behavior that may be involved in emotional eating. Interaction between neural and neuro-endocrine pathways (HPA axis) may be involved. In addition to behavioral interventions, there is a need for a holistic approach encompassing both neural and physiological levels to prevent emotional eating. Based on recent imaging, this review indicates that more attention should be paid to prefrontal areas, the insular and orbitofrontal cortices, and reward pathways, in addition to regions that play a major role in both the cognitive control of emotions and eating behavior. Identifying these brain regions could allow for neuromodulation interventions, including neurofeedback training, which deserves further investigation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The current study tests the influence of two factors, the obesogenic environment and impulsivity, on food intake in primary school children. Our current food environment offers a large variety of cheap and easily available sweet and fatty foods. This obesogenic environment is believed to be a cause of the recent obesity epidemic. Impulsive people are generally less successful at inhibiting prepotent responses and they are reward sensitive. We investigate whether the interaction between an obesogenic environment and an impulsive person leads to overeating. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental 2 (reward sensitive versus not reward sensitive) by 2 (successful response inhibitors versus unsuccessful response inhibitors) by 2 (monotonous versus varied food environment) between-subjects design with caloric intake during a taste test as the main dependent variable. The link between impulsivity and overweight was also examined. SUBJECTS: 78 healthy primary school children (age: 8-10 years). MEASUREMENTS: We measured two aspects of impulsivity: reward sensitivity and deficient response inhibition. Subsequently, one aspect of the obesogenic environment was manipulated; half of the participants received monotonous food during a bogus taste test whereas the other half tasted food that was varied in colour, form, taste and texture. RESULTS: As expected, reward sensitivity interacted with variety. In the monotony group there was no difference in food intake between the less and more reward-sensitive children (183 kcal+/-23 s.d. versus 180 kcal+/-21 s.d.). However, in the variety group the more reward-sensitive children ingested significantly more calories than the less reward-sensitive children (237 kcal+/-30 s.d. versus 141 kcal+/-19 s.d.). Reward sensitivity was not linked to overweight. Deficient response inhibition did not interact with variety, but it was linked to overweight. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that reward sensitivity could be a causal mechanism for overeating in an obesogenic environment whereas prepotent response inhibition may be a maintaining factor of the problem of overeating.},

  abstract = {Neural models of major depressive disorder (MDD) posit that over-response of components of the brain's salience network (SN) to negative stimuli plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of MDD. In the present proof-of-concept study, we tested this formulation directly by examining the affective consequences of training depressed persons to down-regulate response of SN nodes to negative material. Ten participants in the real neurofeedback group saw, and attempted to learn to down-regulate, activity from an empirically identified node of the SN. Ten other participants engaged in an equivalent procedure with the exception that they saw SN-node neurofeedback indices from participants in the real neurofeedback group. Before and after scanning, all participants completed tasks assessing emotional responses to negative scenes and to negative and positive self-descriptive adjectives. Compared to participants in the sham-neurofeedback group, from pre- to post-training, participants in the realneurofeedback group showed a greater decrease in SN-node response to negative stimuli, a greater decrease in self-reported emotional response to negative scenes, and a greater decrease in self-reported emotional response to negative self-descriptive adjectives. Our findings provide support for a neural formulation in which the SN plays a primary role in contributing to negative cognitive biases in MDD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Health advocates have focused on the prevalence of advertising for calorie-dense low-nutrient foods as a significant contributor to the obesity epidemic. This research tests the hypothesis that exposure to food advertising during TV viewing may also contribute to obesity by triggering automatic snacking of available food. DESIGN: In Experiments 1a and 1b, elementary-school-age children watched a cartoon that contained either food advertising or advertising for other products and received a snack while watching. In Experiment 2, adults watched a TV program that included food advertising that promoted snacking and/or fun product benefits, food advertising that promoted nutrition benefits, or no food advertising. The adults then tasted and evaluated a range of healthy to unhealthy snack foods in an apparently separate experiment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Amount of snack foods consumed during and after advertising exposure. RESULTS: Children consumed 45\% more when exposed to food advertising. Adults consumed more of both healthy and unhealthy snack foods following exposure to snack food advertising compared to the other conditions. In both experiments, food advertising increased consumption of products not in the presented advertisements, and these effects were not related to reported hunger or other conscious influences. CONCLUSION: These experiments demonstrate the power of food advertising to prime automatic eating behaviors and thus influence far more than brand preference alone.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that people adjust their intake directly to that of their eating companions; they eat more when others eat more, and less when others inhibit intake. A potential explanation for this modeling effect is that both eating companions' food intake becomes synchronized through processes of behavioral mimicry. No study, however, has tested whether behavioral mimicry can partially account for this modeling effect. To capture behavioral mimicry, real-time observations of dyads of young females having an evening meal were conducted. It was assessed whether mimicry depended on the time of the interaction and on the person who took the bite. A total of 70 young female dyads took part in the study, from which the total number of bites (N = 3,888) was used as unit of analyses. For each dyad, the total number of bites and the exact time at which each person took a bite were coded. Behavioral mimicry was operationalized as a bite taken within a fixed 5-second interval after the other person had taken a bite, whereas non-mimicked bites were defined as bites taken outside the 5-second interval. It was found that both women mimicked each other's eating behavior. They were more likely to take a bite of their meal in congruence with their eating companion rather than eating at their own pace. This behavioral mimicry was found to be more prominent at the beginning than at the end of the interaction. This study suggests that behavioral mimicry may partially account for social modeling of food intake.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Binge-eating disorder (BED) co-occurs with neurobehavioral alterations in the processing of disorder-relevant content such as visual food stimuli. Whether neurofeedback (NF) directly targeting them is suited for treatment remains unclear. This study sought to determine feasibility and estimate effects of individualized, functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based real-time NF (rtfNIRS-NF) and high-beta electroencephalography-based NF (EEG-NF), assuming superiority over waitlist (WL).                                         Methods                                Single-center, assessor-blinded feasibility study with randomization to rtfNIRS-NF, EEG-NF, or WL and assessments at baseline (                 t                 0), postassessment (                 t                 1), and 6-month follow-up (                 t                 2). NF comprised 12 60-min food-specific rtfNIRS-NF or EEG-NF sessions over 8 weeks. Primary outcome was the binge-eating frequency at                 t                 1 assessed interview-based. Secondary outcomes included feasibility, eating disorder symptoms, mental and physical health, weight management-related behavior, executive functions, and brain activity at                 t                 1 and                 t                 2.                                                        Results                                In 72 patients (intent-to-treat), the results showed feasibility of NF regarding recruitment, attrition, adherence, compliance, acceptance, and assessment completion. Binge eating improved at                 t                 1 by −8.0 episodes, without superiority of NF                 v.                 WL (−0.8 episodes, 95\% CI −2.4 to 4.0), but with improved estimates in NF at                 t                 2 relative to                 t                 1. NF was better than WL for food craving, anxiety symptoms, and body mass index, but overall effects were mostly small. Brain activity changes were near zero.                                                        Conclusions                                The results show feasibility of food-specific rtfNIRS-NF and EEG-NF in BED, and no posttreatment differences                 v.                 WL, but possible continued improvement of binge eating. Confirmatory and mechanistic evidence is warranted in a double-blind randomized design with long-term follow-up, considering dose–response relationships and modes of delivery.},

  abstract = {FMRI-based neurofeedback transforms functional brain activation in real-time into sensory stimuli that participants can use to self-regulate brain responses, which can aid the modification of mental states and behavior. Emerging evidence supports the clinical utility of neurofeedback-guided up-regulation of hypoactive networks. In contrast, down-regulation of hyperactive neural circuits appears more difficult to achieve. There are conditions though, in which down-regulation would be clinically useful, including dysfunctional motivational states elicited by salient reward cues, such as food or drug craving. In this proof-of-concept study, 10 healthy females (mean age~=~21.40~years, mean BMI~=~23.53) who had fasted for 4 h underwent a novel 'motivational neurofeedback' training in which they learned to down-regulate brain activation during exposure to appetitive food pictures. FMRI feedback was given from individually determined target areas and through decreases/increases in food picture size, thus providing salient motivational consequences in terms of cue approach/avoidance. Our preliminary findings suggest that motivational neurofeedback is associated with functionally specific activation decreases in diverse cortical/subcortical regions, including key motivational areas. There was also preliminary evidence for a reduction of hunger after neurofeedback and an association between down-regulation success and the degree of hunger reduction. Decreasing neural cue responses by motivational neurofeedback may provide a useful extension of existing behavioral methods that aim to modulate cue reactivity. Our pilot findings indicate that reduction of neural cue reactivity is not achieved by top-down regulation but arises in a bottom-up manner, possibly through implicit operant shaping of target area activity.},

Fifty subjects were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive ten sessions of A/T training [neurofeedback group (NFG)=25], or to act as controls [waiting list group (WLG)=25]. All participants were administered the Food Cravings Questionnaire-Trait, the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. In the post training assessment, compared to the WLG, the NFG showed a significant reduction of intentions and plans to consume food (F1; 49=4.90; p=.033; d=0.626) and of craving as a physiological state (F1; 49=8.09; p=.007; d=803). In NFG, changes in FC persisted after 4months follow-up. Furthermore, A/T training was associated with significant a increase of resting EEG alpha power in several brain areas involved in FC (e.g., insula) and food cue reactivity (e.g., parahippocampal gyrus, inferior and superior temporal gyrus). Taken together, our results showed that ten sessions of A/T training are associated with a decrease of self-reported FC in a non-clinical sample. These findings suggest that this brain-directed intervention may be useful in the treatment of dysfunctional eating behaviors characterized by FC.},

However, to date, there are few studies on the clinical usefulness of feedback-based techniques for eating disorders (EDs) and EDs-related symptoms (e.g., food craving). A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus and PsychINFO identified 162 articles. Among these, thirteen studies exploring the therapeutic use of biofeedback and neurofeedback in EDs or EDs-related symptoms were included. Biofeedback and neurofeedback were implemented respectively in five and eight of all reviewed articles. No studies incorporated different feedback modalities or both biofeedback and neurofeedback. The considered studies provide preliminary data of the usefulness of feedback-based techniques in the treatment of several dysfunctional eating behaviors (e.g., food craving, rumination). Although no significant effect has been reported for other important EDs-related symptoms (i.e., body image disturbance), feedback-based techniques are also associated with significant modifications of both sympathetic reaction to food-related stimuli and brain activity in several regions of the reward system (e.g., insula). Taken together the results of the present review suggest that feedback-based treatments may be useful in the treatment of several dysfunctional eating behaviors operating both on top-down and bottom-up individual coping strategies. Methodological and clinical issues are also discussed.},

This means that soon after, the cues alone can trigger food cue reactivity and food cravings. The learned cue reactivity increases the probability of (over)eating and might sabotage dieting. It is argued that for successful dieting it is necessary to extinguish learned cue reactivity. To reach that goal, the way of dieting is relevant: dieters who avoid highly palatable food cues and dieters who intermittently keep eating high-calorie high-fat palatable foods will remain cue reactive. Only dieters who expose themselves to highly palatable food cues without eating them are expected to show the desired extinction of cue reactivity. Extinction of cue reactivity can be accelerated by prolonged cue exposure with response prevention. During the exposure the overeater is exposed to the cues (e.g., smell and sight of tasty foods) that elicit appetite or craving. The exposure is long lasting and without eating. Whether cue exposure with response prevention is an effective intervention that promotes successful dieting remains to be studied.keywordsconditioned stimulusanorexia nervosaunconditioned stimulusbinge eatingbulimia nervosathese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

  abstract = {Obesity is associated with altered responses to food stimuli in prefrontal brain networks that mediate inhibitory control of ingestive behavior. In particular, activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is reduced in obese compared to normal-weight subjects and has been linked to the success of weight-loss dietary interventions. In a randomized controlled trial in overweight/obese subjects, we investigated the effect on eating behavior of volitional up-regulation of dlPFC activity via real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback training. Thirty-eight overweight or obese subjects (BMI 25–40\,kg/m2) took part in fMRI neurofeedback training with the aim of increasing activity of the left dlPFC (dlPFC group; n\,=\,17) or of the visual cortex (VC/control group; n\,=\,21). Participants were blinded to group assignment. The training session took place on a single day and included three training runs of six trials of up-regulation and passive viewing. Food appraisal and snack intake were assessed at screening, after training, and in a follow-up session four weeks later. Participants of both groups succeeded in up-regulating activity of the targeted brain area. However, participants of the control group also showed increased left dlPFC activity during up-regulation. Functional connectivity between dlPFC and ventromedial PFC, an area that processes food value, was generally increased during up-regulation compared to passive viewing. At follow-up compared to baseline, both groups rated pictures of high-, but not low-calorie foods as less palatable and chose them less frequently. Actual snack intake remained unchanged but palatability and choice ratings for chocolate cookies decreased after training. We demonstrate that one session of fMRI neurofeedback training enables individuals with increased body weight to up-regulate activity of the left dlPFC. Behavioral effects were observed in both groups, which might have been due to dlPFC co-activation in the control group and, in addition, unspecific training effects. Improved dlPFC-vmPFC functional connectivity furthermore suggested enhanced food intake-related control mechanisms.

  abstract = {Obesity is associated with altered responses to food stimuli in prefrontal brain networks that mediate inhibitory control of ingestive behavior. In particular, activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is reduced in obese compared to normal-weight subjects and has been linked to the success of weight-loss dietary interventions. In a randomized controlled trial in overweight/obese subjects, we investigated the effect on eating behavior of volitional up-regulation of dlPFC activity via real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback training. Thirty-eight overweight or obese subjects (BMI 25–40\,kg/m2) took part in fMRI neurofeedback training with the aim of increasing activity of the left dlPFC (dlPFC group; n\,=\,17) or of the visual cortex (VC/control group; n\,=\,21).

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) training of areas involved in emotion processing can reduce depressive symptoms by over 40\% on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). However, it remains unclear if this efficacy is specific to feedback from emotion-regulating regions. We tested in a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial if upregulation of emotion areas (NFE) yields superior efficacy compared to upregulation of a control region activated by visual scenes (NFS). Forty-three moderately to severely depressed medicated patients were randomly assigned to five sessions augmentation treatment of either NFE or NFS training. At primary outcome (week 12) no significant group mean HDRS difference was found (B\,=\,−0.415 [95\% CI −4.847 to 4.016], p\,=\,0.848) for the 32 completers (16 per group). However, across groups depressive symptoms decreased by 43\%, and 38\% of patients remitted. These improvements lasted until follow-up (week 18). Both groups upregulated target regions to a similar extent. Further, clinical improvement was correlated with an increase in self-efficacy scores. However, the interpretation of clinical improvements remains limited due to lack of a sham-control group. We thus surveyed effects reported for accepted augmentation therapies in depression. Data indicated that our findings exceed expected regression to the mean and placebo effects that have been reported for drug trials and other sham-controlled high-technology interventions. Taken together, we suggest that the experience of successful self-regulation during fMRI-NF training may be therapeutic. We conclude that if fMRI-NF is effective for depression, self-regulation training of higher visual areas may provide an effective alternative.},

  abstract = {Obesity reached pandemic proportions and weight-loss treatments are mostly ineffective. The level of brain activity in the reward circuitry is proposed to be proportionate to the reward value of food stimuli, and stronger in people with obesity. However, empirical evidence is inconsistent. This may be due to the double-sided nature of high caloric palatable foods: at once highly palatable and high in calories (unhealthy). This study hypothesizes that, viewing high caloric palatable foods, a hedonic attentional focus compared to a health and a neutral attentional focus elicits more activity in reward-related brain regions, mostly in people with obesity. Moreover, caloric content and food palatability can be decoded from multivoxel patterns of activity most accurately in people with obesity and in the corresponding attentional focus. During one fMRI-session, attentional focus (hedonic, health, neutral) was manipulated using a one-back task with individually tailored food stimuli in 32 healthy-weight people and 29 people with obesity. Univariate analyses (p~{$<~$}0.05, FWE-corrected) showed that brain activity was not different for palatable vs. unpalatable foods, nor for high vs. low caloric foods. Instead, this was higher in the hedonic compared to the health and neutral attentional focus. Multivariate analyses (MVPA) (p~{$<~$}0.05, FDR-corrected) showed that palatability and caloric content could be decoded above chance level, independently of either BMI or attentional focus. Thus, brain activity to visual food stimuli is neither proportionate to the reward value (palatability and/or caloric content), nor significantly moderated by BMI. Instead, it depends on people's attentional focus, and may reflect motivational salience. Furthermore, food palatability and caloric content are represented as patterns of brain activity, independently of BMI and attentional focus. So, food reward value is reflected in patterns, not levels, of brain activity.},

Here, we present the results of a randomized, double-blind clinical trial (NCT02206945) testing this intervention in patients with OCD. We recruited patients with primary symptoms in the fear-of-harm/checking or contamination/washing domains. During neurofeedback, they viewed symptom provocative images and attempted to up- and down-regulate the aPFC during different blocks of time. The active group received two sessions of neurofeedback and the control group received yoked sham feedback. The primary outcome measure was the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Symptom scale. The secondary outcome was control over aPFC. Thirty-six participants completed feedback training (18 active, 18 control). The active group had a slightly but significantly greater reduction of obsessive-compulsive symptoms after neurofeedback compared to the control group (p{$<$}.05) but no significant differences in control over the aPFC. These data demonstrate that neurofeedback targeting the aPFC can reduce symptoms in OCD. Future investigations should seek to optimize the training protocol to yield larger effects and to clarify the mechanism of action.},

The current article reviews the variety literature with a specific focus on the factors that moderate the effects of variety on food intake and that moderate the processes that may underlie the variety effect (i.e., sensory-specific satiety and monotony). The moderators have been categorized as being of either an internal nature or an external nature. The literature suggests that internal moderators, including characteristics such as gender, weight, and dietary restraint, do not act as moderators of the variety effect. One possible exception to the absence of internal moderators is old age. Alternatively, external moderators, such as particular properties of food and the eater's perception of the situation, appear to affect the strength of the variety effect on intake to some degree. An evolutionary hypothesis may account for the distinct roles that internal and external variables play in moderating the variety effect.

The few studies assessing predictors for clinical outcomes after NF and evidenced predictors for psychotherapy guided the selection of baseline eating disorder-related predictors, including objective binge-eating (OBE) frequency, eating disorder psychopathology (EDP), food cravings, and body mass index (BMI), and general psychopathology-related predictors, including depressive and anxiety symptoms, impulsivity, emotion dysregulation, and self-efficacy. These questionnaire-based or objectively assessed (BMI) predictors were regressed on outcomes OBE frequency and EDP as key features of BED at post-treatment (t1) and 6-month follow-up (t2) in preregistered generalized mixed models (https://osf.io/4aktp). Results Higher EDP, food cravings, and BMI predicted worse outcomes across all groups at t1 and t2. General psychopathology-related predictors did not predict outcomes at t1 and t2. Explorative analyses indicated that lower OBE frequency and higher self-efficacy predicted lower OBE frequency, and lower EDP predicted lower EDP after the waiting period in WL. Discussion Consistent with findings for psychotherapy, higher eating disorder-related predictors were associated with higher EDP and OBE frequency. The specificity of psychopathological predictors for NF treatment success warrants further examination. Public Significance This exploratory study firstly assessed eating disorder- and psychopathology-related predictors for neurofeedback treatment outcome in binge-eating disorder and overweight. Findings showed an association between higher eating disorder symptoms and worse neurofeedback outcomes, indicating special needs to be considered in neurofeedback treatment for patients with a higher binge-eating disorder symptom burden. In general, outcomes and assignment to neurofeedback treatment may be improved upon consideration of baseline psychological variables.},

  abstract = {Disinhibited eating (DE) behaviors - such as overeating or binge eating - are common dysfunctional behaviors, especially in female populations. These behaviors can contribute to developments of overweight or obesity, and associated negative health consequences, like non-communicable diseases or eating disorders. Still, treatments for DE show moderate efficacy and may benefit from improvements. Recently, experts called for more research on brain-directed treatments to target DE and related eating disorders. Neurofeedback (NFB), using electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, is a well-established and safe neuromodulatory approach, based on an acquisition and online feedback of EEG-signals. It enables patients to regulate brain activity associated with dysfunctional psychological states or behaviors. However, EEG NFB had - to date - not been evaluated for the treatment of DE. The present doctoral thesis reports on the development and evaluation of an EEG NFB protocol for the treatment of DE. The protocol is based on a synthesis of current theories on the etiology of DE, empirical findings regarding associated psychophysiological activity, and adaptable treatment components. It consists of ten sessions and incorporates self-regulation of tense physiological arousal, marked by EEG high beta activity, after exposure with personalized food cues. Two randomized controlled trials and an experimental EEG study aimed at the evaluation of the general and specific treatment efficacy, as well as treatment mechanisms of the NFB. The studies were conducted in subclinical samples of female restrained eaters with DE. Study 1 (initial sample: n = 34) compared a NFB group to a waitlist group and yielded evidence for the general efficacy of the NFB in reducing DE episodes. Results remained stable to a three-month follow-up. Further, the new NFB was well-accepted by the participants. In Study 2 (initial sample: n = 75), NFB and an additional intervention with a highly comparable treatment (mental imagery) were compared to a waitlist condition. NFB, but not the alternative intervention, resulted in significant post-treatment reductions of DE episodes compared to the waitlist. Results remained stable to a three-month follow-up and indicated specific efficacy of the NFB approach. Study 3 (n = 36) aimed at an evaluation of relevant treatment mechanisms in NFB. The experimental study compared the presence and influence of physiological learning (regulation of EEG high beta activity) and psychological learning (enhanced somatic self-efficacy) in the NFB and control intervention group. Analyses showed that physiological learning was only present in the NFB group and showed stronger relations to treatment outcomes than somatic self-efficacy. According to these results, physiological learning constitutes a relevant treatment mechanism in the developed NFB protocol. In summary, the developed NFB could be evaluated as an efficacious and physiologically-based treatment approach for the treatment of DE. It may be a beneficial adjunct for treatments of eating disorders (e.g., binge eating disorder). Based on the results of this dissertation project, replications in clinical groups are now warranted. Additional implications for research and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Overeating episodes, despite of intentions to control weight, are a common problem among women. Recurring episodes of overeating and dietary failure have been reported to result in higher Body Mass Indexes and to induce severe distress even in non-clinical groups. Based on findings from physiological research on eating behavior and craving, as well as previous biofeedback studies, we derived a cue exposure based EEG neurofeedback protocol to target overeating episodes. The treatment was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial, comparing a neurofeedback group (NFG; n~=~14) with a waiting list control group (WLG; n~=~13) in a sub-clinical sample of female restrained eaters. At post-treatment, the number of weekly overeating episodes and subsequent distress were significantly reduced in the NFG compared to the WLG (p~{$<~$}.01; r~{$>~$}.50). In a 3~month follow-up, effects in the NFG remained stable. As secondary outcomes, perceived dieting~success was enhanced after the treatment. At follow-up, additional beneficial effects on trait food craving were observed. Altogether, we found preliminary evidence for the cue exposure neurofeedback against overeating episodes in female restrained eaters, although specific effects and underlying mechanisms still have to be explored in future research.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives This study tested whether two sessions of food cue exposure therapy reduced eating in the absence of hunger (EAH), specified for exposed and non-exposed food, in overweight and obese adolescents, and whether habituation of food cue reactivity and reduced CS-US expectancies predicted a decrease in EAH. Methods 41 overweight adolescents (aged 12–18 years) were randomly assigned to a cue exposure intervention or a lifestyle intervention (control condition). Habituation of food cue reactivity (self-reported desire to eat and salivation) and CS-US expectancy were measured during both sessions, and EAH was measured at the end of session two. Results Compared to the control condition, the cue exposure condition showed less EAH for the exposed food item as well as for the non-exposed food items. Larger within-session (WSH) and between-session habituation (BSH) of cue reactivity were not related to less EAH, change in CS-US expectancy was unrelated to EAH. Limitations The study was underpowered, and compliance to homework instructions between sessions was poor, intervention effects might have been larger when participants adhered to daily homework exercises. Conclusions Food cue exposure was effective to reduce EAH of exposed and non-exposed food items, indicating generalisability of the exposure effect. In line with exposure effects in anxiety disorders, habituation was not found to benefit outcome, though the present data do also not provide evidence that CS-US expectancy violation predicts EAH.},

  abstract = {fMRI Neurofeedback research employs many different control conditions. Currently, there is no consensus as to which control condition is best, and the answer depends on what aspects of the neurofeedback-training design one is trying to control for. These aspects can range from determining whether participants can learn to control brain activity via neurofeedback to determining whether there are clinically significant effects of the neurofeedback intervention. Lack of consensus over criteria for control conditions has hampered the design and interpretation of studies employing neurofeedback protocols. This paper presents an overview of the most commonly employed control conditions currently used in neurofeedback studies and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. Control conditions covered include no control, treatment-as-usual, bidirectional-regulation control, feedback of an alternative brain signal, sham feedback, and mental-rehearsal control. We conclude that the selection of the control condition(s) should be determined by the specific research goal of the study and best procedures that effectively control for relevant confounding factors.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review It is in the brain where the decision is made what and how much to eat. In the last decades neuroimaging research has contributed extensively to new knowledge about appetite control by revealing the underlying brain processes. Interestingly, there is the fast growing idea of using these methods to develop new treatments for obesity and eating disorders. In this review, we summarize the findings of the importance of the use of neuropharmacology and neuroimaging techniques in understanding and modifying appetite control. Recent findings Appetite control is a complex interplay between homeostatic, hedonic, and cognitive processes. Administration of the neuropeptides insulin and oxytocin curb food intake and alter brain responses in reward and cognitive control areas. Additionally, these areas can be targeted for neuromodulation or neurofeedback to reduce food cravings and increase self-control to alter food intake. Summary The recent findings reveal the potential of intranasal administration of hormones or modifying appetite control brain networks to reduce food consumption in volunteers with overweight and obesity or individuals with an eating disorder. Although long-term clinical studies are still needed.},

We investigated the potential of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback training to achieve healthier food choices by enhancing self-control of the interplay between these brain areas. We trained eight male individuals with overweight or obesity (age: 31.8~±~4.4 years, BMI: 29.4~±~1.4~kg/m2) to up-regulate functional connectivity between the dlPFC and the vmPFC by means of a four-day rt-fMRI neurofeedback protocol including, on each day, three training runs comprised of six up-regulation and six passive viewing trials. During the up-regulation runs of the four training days, participants successfully learned to increase functional connectivity between dlPFC and vmPFC. In addition, a trend towards less high-calorie food choices emerged from before to after training, which however was associated with a trend towards increased covertly assessed snack intake. Findings of this proof-of-concept study indicate that overweight and obese participants can increase functional connectivity between brain areas that orchestrate the top-down control of appetite for high-calorie foods. Neurofeedback training might therefore be a useful tool in achieving and maintaining weight loss.},

  abstract = {Food selection is primarily guided by the visual system. Multiple functional neuro-imaging studies have examined the brain responses to visual food stimuli. However, the results of these studies are heterogeneous and there still is uncertainty about the core brain regions involved in the neural processing of viewing food pictures. The aims of the present study were to determine the concurrence in the brain regions activated in response to viewing pictures of food and to assess the modulating effects of hunger state and the food's energy content. We performed three Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses on data from healthy normal weight subjects in which we examined: 1) the contrast between viewing food and nonfood pictures (17 studies, 189 foci), 2) the modulation by hunger state (five studies, 48 foci) and 3) the modulation by energy content (seven studies, 86 foci). The most concurrent brain regions activated in response to viewing food pictures, both in terms of ALE values and the number of contributing experiments, were the bilateral posterior fusiform gyrus, the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the left middle insula. Hunger modulated the response to food pictures in the right amygdala and left lateral OFC, and energy content modulated the response in the hypothalamus/ventral striatum. Overall, the concurrence between studies was moderate: at best 41\% of the experiments contributed to the clusters for the contrast between food and nonfood. Therefore, future research should further elucidate the separate effects of methodological and physiological factors on between-study variations.},

Yet research has not investigated this relation using objective brain imaging or tested whether attentional bias to food stimuli predicts future weight gain, which are important aims given the prominence of food cues in the environment. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine attentional bias in 35 adolescent girls ranging from lean to obese using an attention network task involving food and neutral stimuli. BMI correlated positively with speed of behavioral response to both appetizing food stimuli and unappetizing food stimuli, but not to neutral stimuli. BMI correlated positively with activation in brain regions related to attention and food reward, including the anterior insula/frontal operculum, lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and superior parietal lobe, during initial orientation to food cues. BMI also correlated with greater activation in the anterior insula/frontal operculum during reallocation of attention to appetizing food images and with weaker activation in the medial OFC and ventral pallidum during reallocation of attention to unappetizing food images. Greater lateral OFC activation during initial orientation to appetizing food cues predicted future increases in BMI. Results indicate that overweight is related to greater attentional bias to food cues and that youth who show elevated reward circuitry responsivity during food cue exposure are at increased risk for weight gain.},
